Collatz sequence is a sequence in mathematics in which any positive integer n eventually evaluates into 1 using a fixed algorithm.

If n is a even number, the resulting is divided by 2(n/2) while if n is odd number, it is then multiplied by 3 then plus 1(3n + 1). Using this algorithm the number will eventually result in 1.

For example:
if n = 5

5	odd	(3*5 + 1) = 16
16	even	16/2	  = 8
8	even	8/2	  = 4
4	even	4/2	  = 2
2	even	2/2	  = 1


This algorithm works on any positive integer n.
